    <h2>Shiatzy Chen SS20</h2>
    <p>
        I worked with Nhu Xuan Hua, a French-Vietnamese artist and photographer, on the SS20 campaign for Taiwanese brand Shiatzy Chen.

        In the short film, the models pass between an infinite bamboo labyrinth and a liminal void.
        I wanted to establish aural breadth with the listener, and used sampled knocks, water droplets, and detuned whistles to create a non-ordinary listening space.

        The main melodic motifs are played by a treated and distorted Rhodes, which also appears with harmonic stings throughout the piece. Harsh cuts into sub-bass pulls the listener back to the void-space. 
        A countermelody is played by a doubled piano and harp, flowing together as fabric and bamboo.
        A saturated and widely-panned Rhodes chord touches another sonic space in the listener's ears.
