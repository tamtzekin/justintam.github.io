    <h2>Skyline Death</h2>
    <p>
        Debut album released on Eternal Dragonz, 2018.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Skyline Death is a fictional demo CD found among the wreckage of a heavenly car crash.
    </p>

    <p>
        RnB, improvisation, and trance have always been at the heart of the sounds closest to me. Cantonese ballads, improvisation and jazz, trance in early '00s k-pop and EDM all share a love for saccharine melodies and unrestrained emotion.
    </p>

    <p>
        While touring as a DJ between 2016-2018, I met artists across Asia who were emulating the sounds of RnB, rap, grime and the club that they heard coming out of the west.
        At the same time, a lot of American music trends were crossing over into k-pop and mutating into a sound of their own.
        I wanted to create a full body of work that captured that moment in time, and how independent artists were making that sound their own.
        To write this album I worked with k-pop ghostwriters from Seoul, rappers from Kuala Lumpar, ballad singers from Hong Kong, RnB crooners from Singapore, and grime MCs from Hyogo.

    <h2>Hush ft. Alice Vicious - Music Video</h2>
        'Hush' is what emerged when Veron (x/o) and I wrote a song inspired by the darker sounds in k-pop.
        Veron wrote a hook over my instrumental, and we co-wrote the lyrics in English. Alice Vicious (an artist from Seoul who's written for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3mm3tPKfg" target="_blank">TAEMIN</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmBYPXGqtss" target="_blank">GFRIEND</a>), rewrote the hook with a different flow in Korean.
    </p>
    
        <p>
            When shooting the video, director Radge Ratsaphong and I wanted to find spaces that formed part of our collective mythology as Asians in Australia. 
            We picked the edges of highways and suburban bush wastelands in Sydney's south, where I grew up, which often end up as the spaces immigrants are pushed out to.
