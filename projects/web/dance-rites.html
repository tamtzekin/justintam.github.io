    <h2>An audio-visual guide to Dance Rites</h2>
    <h3>Sydney Opera House, 2019</h3>
    <p>
        Every year, the Sydney Opera House holds Dance Rites, a national First Nations dance competition inviting groups from across First Nations in Australia to perform.
    </p>

    <p>
        We wanted to create an engaging online 'handbook' that introduced readers to the groups, as well as teaching them about the lives of First Peoples through language.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was inspired by the New York Times' <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/11/style/this-is-18.html" target="_blank">'This is 18'</a> feature, as well as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/13/arts/lil-uzi-vert-xo-tour-llif3-push-me-to-the-edge.html" target="_blank">'Have You Heard This?'</a> series, which uses the <a href="https://github.com/NUKnightLab/soundcite/" target="_blank">Soundcite</a> library to create 'listenable' lyric snippets. We used the same library to create clickable audio definitions in language, which I recorded (narrated by Rhoda Roberts), edited and mixed in the Opera House's recording & broadcast studio.
        The full-width carousel was written using the <a href="https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/" target="_blank">Slick</a> library.
        The website was developed using Shorthand, a platform designed for visual and interactive editorial features.
