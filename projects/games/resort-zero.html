    <h2>Resort Zero</h2>
    <p>
        As part of the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/haunted-ps1-summer-spooks" target="_blank">Haunted PS1 gamejam</a>, we had a month to make a PSX-style horror game to the theme of 'architectural horror'.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Hotel Zero is a first-person narrative-heavy horror game. You play a travel writer interviewing residents of a hotel via their room intercoms. Each resident's ideologies are tied to the hotel's very nature in increasingly disturbing ways.
    </p>

    <p>
        I was lead writer on the project, composed the music and sound design, and also worked on narrative scripting and level design.
    </p>

    <p>
        Built in Unity, scripted in <a href="https://github.com/inkle/inky" target="_blank">Ink</a> + Inky editor, project management using Trello.
    </p>
