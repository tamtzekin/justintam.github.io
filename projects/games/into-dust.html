    <h2>Into Dust</h2>
    <p>
        As part of the Global Game Jam 2018, game designer/programmer <a href="https://jemztones.itch.io/" target="_blank">Jae Stuart</a> and I wanted to make a game set during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHXVh8aMlHo" target="_blank">2009 Sydney dust storm</a>.
        We were inspired by first-person narrative games ('walking sims'), and wanted to create a game about grief and relationships, and how a near-supernatural event might affect how someone processes personal trauma.
    </p>

    <p>
        I worked on level design, game design and concepts, music composition and sound design.
    </p>

    <p>
        The game was featured at <a href="https://www.amaze-berlin.de/" target="_blank">aMAZE Berlin</a> and at the <a href="https://unity.com/event/unite-sydney-2019" target="_blank">Unity conference 2019</a>.
